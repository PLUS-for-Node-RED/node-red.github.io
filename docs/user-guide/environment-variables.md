### Setting a node property

Any node property can be set with an environment variable by setting its value
to a string of the form `${ENV_VAR}`. When the runtime loads the flows, it will
substitute the value of that environment variable before passing it to the node.

This only works if it replaces the entire property - it cannot be used to substitute
just part of the value. For example, it is *not* possible to use `CLIENT-${HOST}`.

As nodes provide their own edit dialog, not all properties will provide a text
input that can be used to enter the env-var string. In that case, you may consider
hand-editing the flow file to set the property.


### Using the TypedInput widget

<div style="width: 222px" class="figure align-right">
  <img src="editor/images/editor-typedInput-envvar-expanded.png" alt="TypedInput Environment Variable">
  <p class="caption">TypedInput Environment Variable type</p>
</div>


Within the editor, the TypedInput widget can offer 'environment variable' as a type.
When this type is selected, its value will be evaluated as follows:

 - if there is no `${}` present, uses the whole value as the name of the environment
   variable.
   For example, `"FOO"` will be replaced with the value of `process.env.FOO`


 - if `${}` is present, it will substitute the corresponding environment
   variable into the result:
   For example, given the value `"Hello ${FOO}"` and the env var `FOO` is set to `World`,
   this results in the value `"Hello World"`



### JSONata Expressions

Environment variables can be accessed in JSONata expressions, such as in the Change
node, using the `$env` function:

```javascript
$env('ENV_VAR')
```

### Function node

Within a Function node, environment variables get be accessed using the `env.get`
function:

```javascript
let foo = env.get("FOO");
```

### Built-In Environment Variables

*Since Node-RED 2.2*

Node-RED maintains its own set of environment variables for exposing information about the node itself. This information helps "locate" the node in your [workspace](/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/index.md). Nodes in your workspace exist as part of a [flow](/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/flows.md). Likewise, a node may (or may not) be part of a [group](/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/groups.md). Nodes, flows and groups are each given unique IDs that are generated by Node-RED.

Nodes, flows and groups all support the `name` property, which you can change when [editing properties](/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/nodes.md#editing-node-properties).

The following environment variables can be used to access this contextual information for the node.

    - `NR_NODE_ID`
    - `NR_NODE_NAME`
    - `NR_GROUP_ID`
    - `NR_GROUP_NAME`
    - `NR_FLOW_ID`
    - `NR_FLOW_NAME`

Note that while the IDs generated by Node-RED are guaranteed to be unique, the names are not. If a node, flow or group is not given a name, then the corresponding environment variable will return an empty string. If a node is not part of a group, its group id environment variable will also return an empty string.

### Subflow Instance properties

Since 0.20, Subflows can be configured with instance properties. These appear as
environment variables within the Subflow and can be customised for individual instances
of the subflow.

For example, given a REST API that provides access to different types of record,
a subflow could be created to access the API and handle the response, using an
environment variable to identify which type of record should be accessed. Individual
instances of the Subflow can then be customised for those particular types.

### Flow/Group level environment variable 

Since 2.21, environment variables can be set for Flow or Group on their settings panel.

### Predefined environment variable

Since 2.22, following predefined environment variables has been added that provides access to information about the node, group and flow.

- `NR_NODE_ID` - the ID of the node
- `NR_NODE_NAME` - the Name of the node
- `NR_NODE_NAME` - the Path of the node

   The node's path represents a node's hierarchy in a flow.  It is `/`
   delimited IDs of the flow, enclosing subflows, and the node.
- `NR_GROUP_ID` - the ID of the containing group
- `NR_GROUP_NAME` - the Name of the containing group
- `NR_FLOW_ID` - the ID of the flow the node is on
- `NR_FLOW_NAME` - the Name of the flow the node is on

### Accessing nested environment variable

Environment variable definition is searched from the bottom to the top
of the node's definition hierarchy. `$ parent.` prefix can be added to
environment variable name (e.g. `$parent.NR_GROUP_NAME`) to move the
start position of this search up one level in the hierarchy.
